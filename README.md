# Paper Airplane

This is a simple game about a paper airplane lost in space that has to avoid crashing into asteroids. It’s really nothing more than a Flappy Bird clone but I like this game because it’s easy to program and fun to play. I tend to use it as a learning exercise whenever I try a new game engine. In this case, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
